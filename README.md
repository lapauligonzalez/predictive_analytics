# Predictive Analytics
This repository contains all the work I completed for the Predictive Analytics course, including the final coursework and the code used for the course evaluations.

In this course we learned how to apply machine learning techniques to build models that explain or predict a target variable based on other features. We explored the difference between regression and classification in supervised learning, and evaluated model performance using metrics like MSE, variance, and bias, while considering the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting. We covered methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, LDA, QDA, decision trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and learned how to properly prepare and split data for training and testing. Additionally, we studied exploratory data analysis techniques, correlation measures, categorical variable encoding, and clustering as an example of unsupervised learning. Finally, we worked with tools like Python, Scikit-learn, pandas, and TensorFlow to implement models and apply key concepts like loss functions, gradient descent, and cross-validation.
